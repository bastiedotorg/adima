# Correctness

**Believing**  
MLC-ADIMA holds the Correctness OP {Correctness}  

**Is justified by applying**  
MLC-ADIMA implementation is correct w.r.t DIB, under FOC  

**To these premises**  
{CR-Performance} MLC-ADIMA implementation satisfies performance requirements within Nominal conditions  
{CR-Abnormal} MLC-ADIMA implementation identifies off-nominal conditions and reports them  
{CR-Robustness} MLC-ADIMA implementation is robust for outside of ODD conditions  
{CR-Generalization} MLC-ADIMA implementation can generalize with DeB  
{CR-TargetHWData} Target hardware and real data are used for correctness activities.
