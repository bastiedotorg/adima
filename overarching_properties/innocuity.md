# Innocuity

**Believing**  
MLC-ADIMA holds the Innocuity OP {Innocuity}  

**Is justified by applying**  
Any part of the executable MLC-ADIMA that is not required by the DIB has no unacceptable impact.  

**To these premises**  
{IO-UnIntBeh} Unintended behaviors caused by the implementation choice of using neural networks are identified as stability, generalization, outside of distribution, data-drift, incompleteness of the data, or ODD  
{IO-Stability} MLC-ADIMA performance does not get affected by adding 10% of noise to Data  
{IO-Sensitivity} MLC-ADIMA performance does not get affected by changes in the network  
{IO-Outliers} Outliers do not affect the safety of the system
