|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HR-R1    | The system shall automatically detect and identify the color of each LED (manufacturer Dicuno, red, green, blue, and yellow) connected to the avionics modules.  |
| HR-R2    | The system shall classify the health (fully operational, degraded, worn, defective, unknown peripheral) for each connected LED during every bootup.              |
| HR-R3    | The system shall generate a maintenance report for any LED classified as worn, defective, or other.                                                              |
| HR-R4    | The system shall operate within a temperature range of 10°C to 60°C.                                                                                             |
| HR-R5    | The system shall operate in a humidity range of 20% to 100%.                                                                                                     |
| HR-R6    | The system shall operate at a pressure range of 70 kPa to 105 kPa.                                                                                               |
| HR-R7    | The system shall predict the health of each LED with less than 5% false positives and less than 1% false negatives.                                              |
| HR-R8    | The system shall work with a cable length range of 0.1 meter to 5 meters.                                                                                        |
| HR-R9    | The system shall prioritize the functionality of emergency lighting due to its safety-critical nature.                                                           |
| HR-R10   | The system shall not have passive failures of the emergency lighting due to common mode error.                                                                   |
| HR-R11   | The system shall not have out-of-control failures.                                                                                                               |
| HR-R12   | The system shall execute on a state-of-the-art IMA platform.                                                                                                     |
